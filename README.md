# Running the website
- Make sure you have Nodejs 18 or higher installed.
- Install the dependencies using the command `npm ci`.
- Run the project from the root directory using the command `npm run dev`.
- Go to `localhost:5173` in your browser to view the website, or press `o` in the terminal where you ran `npm run dev`.


- Alternatively, you can view the hosted website [here](mikhauct.github.io/furniture-store/), and find the source code [here](https://github.com/MikhaUCT/furniture-store).

# Development Details
- The website is built using (Svelte)[https://svelte.dev/], SCSS & Typescript.
- All CSS, HTML & Typescript was hand written by me. CSS frameworks are for the weak ;)
- The Search bar does not work because there was way too little time to implement it.
- I started to make the site responsive to different screen sizes, but ran out of time. Fortunately there were no marks allocated for this.
- The checkout page is not to my standard. I ran out of time.
